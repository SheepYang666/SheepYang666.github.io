I am a researcher focusing on **LiDAR-IMU SLAM** and **3D perception** for robotics applications. My research interests include:

- **LiDAR-Inertial Odometry**: Tight-coupled optimization for robust state estimation
- **Voxel-based Mapping**: Efficient 3D map representation using voxel maps
- **Challenging Environments**: SLAM in degenerate scenarios (corridors, staircases, etc.)
- **Real-time Systems**: Efficient algorithms for on-board robotic applications

I am the author of **[VINA-SLAM](/projects/vina-slam)**, a voxel-based inertial and normal-aligned LiDAR-IMU SLAM system designed for challenging environments with sparse geometric structures.

## Research Interests

- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO)
- 3D Point Cloud Processing
- Factor Graph Optimization
- Robot State Estimation
