  abstract      = {
    We present VINA-SLAM, a robust LiDAR-Inertial odometry system designed for 
    challenging environments with sparse or repetitive geometric structures. 
    Our approach establishes a global voxel map that collects structural cues, 
    uses normal-guided correspondence strategies, and employs tangent-space 
    metrics to supplement rotation constraints in local Bundle Adjustment.
